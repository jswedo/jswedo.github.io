		<p><strong>Selecting Good Sources<br>
		Academic vs. Non-Academic Sources</strong>
		</p>
		 
		<p>Research is a process of investigation examining a subject from different points of view using various sources and forms of data. Research is a hunt for the truth – it’s a way to educate yourself and to develop deep knowledge on a subject.
		</p> 
		 
		<p><strong>I. Selecting Sources:</strong>
		</p>
		 
		<p><strong>a) General Encyclopedias</strong>
		</p>
		
		<p>General encyclopedias, like <i>World Book</i>, are rarely sufficiently detailed to support a research project, although an encyclopedia like World Book will provide both an author’s name and a scholarly treatment of a subject with a list of references included with longer articles so you may conduct further research. Subject Encyclopedias, which are encyclopedias on specific subjects – like careers – literature – authors – history - provide more detailed information on specialized areas. A good jumping off point when beginning research is to consult general encyclopedias and subject encyclopedias to gain a basic understanding of a subject and for suggestions for further research.
		</p>

		<p>Since Wikipedia is an "online encyclopedia", why is it not considered an appropriate source?
		</p>

		<p>Wikipedia is user-created content, which means anyone, including your dog, can get an account to be an "editor". You do not need to be qualified. You will be asked no questions about your knowledge, background, education, or ability to provide accurate, up-to-date information on the topic. Therefore, Wikipedia articles can easily be and have been vandalized. Unless you are willing to put your grade on the line by using such a poor source for the basis of your academic writing - please do not use Wikipedia. Be aware that teachers and professors tend to be "experts" on the assignments they assign to students - so they typically know a great deal about the subject and about what is available "in the literature". Don't risk your grade. More information about Wikipedia is available on this library webpage -- Scroll down. 
		</p>

		<p>Free online encyclopedias are NOT - good sources. See this article about Encyclopedia Britannica: Article. Print encyclopedias, like World Book, are at least authoritative in nature and a good, general source.
		</p>

		<p><strong>b) Books and Periodicals</strong>
		</p>
		 
		<p>When conducting in-depth research, consult books and current periodicals.
		</p>

		<p>Why are books good sources?
		</p>

		<p>Books go through the publishing process and provide full, verifiable information about the person(s) writing the book. To evaluate a book's usefulness to your topic, consider these things:
		</p>

		<p>Author<br>
		Date of publication<br>
		Edition<br>
		Publisher - is it a University Press?<br>
		Intended Audience<br>
		Objectivity - is it based on opinion, fact, propaganda; can a bias be determined<br>
		Coverage - does the material in the book update other sources; does it included references to previous research<br>
		</p>

		<p>You can research the author of the book and look up book reviews about the book. You can also look for a preview of the book on Google Books.
		</p>

		<p>What are periodicals?
		</p> 
		
		<p>Periodicals are newspapers, magazines and journals that are published at regular intervals. However, magazines and journals are really different in the scope and authority.
		</p> 

		<p>Popular publications like Newsweek and Time are not considered academic sources. On the other hand, journals are always considered to be academic in nature.
		</p>

		<p>Articles in popular periodicals provide articles geared toward the general population, written in easy-to-read language and are selected by a magazine’s editor.
		</p>

		<p>Articles in journals provide research in specialized fields conducted by scholars. The journal articles are geared toward academic readers and are written in scholarly language – which may includes graphs, charts, and studies. They are selected by experts in the field by a process called “peer review”.
		</p> 
		 
		<p><strong>II. How to Evaluate Books and Periodicals</strong>
		</p>
		 
		<p>One way to evaluate a source is to check for a bibliography at the end of the article or book. Most scholarly books and articles are based on previous research. They may provide a list of references upon which the material was based. Those references can provide the reader to other information on the topic.
		</p>

		<p>Most scholarly articles will provide an abstract that explains the article’s primary focus.
		</p> 
		
		<p>Biographical information on the article's author can also provide important clues to the nature of the article. An author who is university faculty or a noted authority in a certain field most likely can be counted on to provide scholarly information, providing they are writing in the field in which they are considered knowledgeable. However, if the author is an I.T. manager in India who is writing about Abraham Lincoln, you might consider a better source.
		</p> 
		 
		<p><strong>III. Online Sources - Academic Research Databases</strong>
		</p>

		<p>EBSCO is the vendor from which JSerra leases research databases that our students may use when conducting academic research. To access EBSCO, you need our private login information. When logging into EBSCO, you will find multiple databases to choose from which can provide you with academic information on all kinds of subjects. To see a list of journals and other sources in EBSCO, see this Link: <a href="http://www.ebscohost.com/title-lists">Title Lists</a>.
		</p> 
		 
		<p>What about General Internet Sources?
		</p>

		<p>Here is a video from Widener University on how to evaluate Internet sources: <a href="http://www.widener.edu/Media/Website%20Resources/flash/How_to_Evaluate_9.swf">Click Link</a>.
		</p>

		<p>Internet Sources may or may not be academic sources, as they vary widely in nature. In order to use Internet webpages for academic research, you need to go through the proper steps to verify these things about each webpage:
		</p>

		<p>Author – who is the author; what are his/her/their qualifications?
		</p>

		<p>Sponsor – who is the sponsor of the webpage (look at the page and at the URL).
		</p>

		<p>Currency – when was the information written?
		</p>

		<p>Bias – Is the information provided with little or no bias? If bias can be determined, you must keep that bias in mind if using the information on that webpage in your research.
		</p> 
		
		<p>So...What about Blogs?
		</p> 
		
		<p>Good question - what about them? Blogs are basically primary sources. They can provide lively conversations and perspectives not typically documented by traditional sources, since they do not go through any formal publication process.
		</p>

		<p>Anyone can blog. My dog, Yuki, can blog. 
		</p>
		
		<img src="img/Yuki.jpg" height="200" width="160"><br>
		
		<p>Because of this openness, how do we evaluate a blog when we want to use it for research?
		</p>

		<p>The evaluation techniques are similar to those for websites and print materials:
		</p>

		<p>Who is the blogger?<br>
		What sorts of materials is the blogger reading or citing?<br>
		Does this blogger have a lot of followers?<br>
		Is this content covered in any depth or with any authority?<br>
		How sophisticated is the language and the spelling?<br>
		How current are the posts? Is there a substantial archive?<br>
		</p>

		<p>Let's consider these two blogs:
		</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.mrbyrneteaches.com/">Mr. Byrne Teaches</a>
		</p>
		 
		<p><a href="http://www.videogamesblogger.com/">VideoGamesBlogger</a>
		</p>

		<p>If you want to use a blog as an academic source, be prepared to verify the authority of the blogger.
		</p>
		 
		<p><strong>IV. Primary vs. Secondary Sources</strong>
		</p>

		<p>A primary source is a document, article, book, photo, etc. written/produced/manufactured by the actual author/witness/participant. For example, a video taken by a survivor of the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center would be considered a primary source on that event. A secondary source is a document, article, book, photo, etc. written/produced/manufactured by a third party about the event.
		</p> 
		
		<p>Here is an exercise on selecting sources from the University of Georgia Libraries: <a href="http://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit01/infoage01_05.phtml">Click Link</a>.
		</p> 
		 
		<p><strong>V. Judge for Yourself</strong>
		</p>
		 
		<p>Learning how to evaluate proper sources takes a little time and can actually be fun. Below, I have uploaded a handout for further information about how to evaluate books, articles, and websites.
		</p>

		<p><strong>VI. Assignment Calculator:</strong>
		</p>
		 
		<p>Here is a link to UCLA's Assignment Calculator. It will help you organize your research project and provide links to extra resources. <a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/library/modules/freecalc/index.php">AssignCalc</a>.
		</p> 
		 
		<p><strong>VII. Wikipedia, aka the "faith-based encyclopedia"</strong>
		</p>
		 
		<p>There are so many reasons not to use Wikipedia as an academic source. The most important one is JSerra faculty will not count it towards your required sources. College professors will not allow its use either. Here are some other reasons, and I will continue to add to this list as the stories surface.
		</p>
		 
		<p>Here is a good video from Rutgers University (via YouTube) explaining why Wikipedia is not to be used for academic research: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPC-bNX9O_E">Wikipedia Tutorial</a>.
		</p>

		<p>Jimmy Wales, creator of Wikipedia, says not to use Wikipedia for academic research. Read this link: <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Wikipedia-Founder-Discourages/2305">Jimmy Wales</a>.
		</p>

		<p>Articles in Wikipedia can be vandalized and used to destroy a person's reputation. See this article regarding using Wikipedia as a "joke": <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm">Siegenthaler</a>.
